## Installation:  

Visual Studio Code 

## Usage:

To practice making animations using JavaScript and HTML.

## Support:

N/A

## Roadmap: 

We were supplied a JavaScript file and an HTML file which provided the basis for producing circles and generating animations with them. My idea was originally to make "rain" with falling tiny circles of shades of blue. However, I did not figure that out. Instead, I made randomly colored dots fall. I am still learning!
